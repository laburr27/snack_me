# snack_me

WDI14 - Project 2; app that creates snacks out of 2 food items

An app called "Snack Me!" - the idea is to make it easier for people to snack healthier while still satisfying cravings that tend to derail good intentions.

The MVP will list categories of foods a person can combine to make a snack with categories that are things people crave like salty, sweet, crunchy, savory, creamy, crispy

The Gold version verson will be able to add contraints such as sodium and sugar content and criteria such as high protein and whole grains

The Platinum would use a db of UPC codes so a person will get actual products back and there would be a "surprise me" randomizer
